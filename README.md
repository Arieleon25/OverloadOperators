# OverloadOperators

The OverloadOperators project is a console application that demonstrates operator overloading in C#. It includes the implementation of the "==" operator overload to check if two Employee objects are equal by comparing their Id property.

# Project Description
The OverloadOperators project consists of two files: Employee.cs and Program.cs.

Employee.cs

This file contains the Employee class, which represents an employee. The Employee class has properties such as Id, FirstName, and LastName. It also includes the implementation of the == operator overload to compare two Employee objects based on their Id property.

Program.cs

This file contains the Program class, which contains the Main method. In the Main method, the program creates two instances of the Employee class and assigns different values to their properties. It then uses the == operator to compare the two Employee objects based on their Id property. The result of the comparison is printed to the console.

# Instructions
Start the console application.

The program will create two instances of the Employee class.

The Employee objects will have different values assigned to their properties, including the Id property.

The program will use the == operator to compare the two Employee objects based on their Id property.

The result of the comparison (true or false) will be displayed in the console.

The program will terminate.

You can rerun the program to create new instances of the Employee class and test the operator overload functionality.

# Skills Demonstrated
This project demonstrates the following skills and concepts related to operator overloading in C#:

Overloading the == operator

Comparing objects based on specific properties

Implementing custom equality comparison for a class
